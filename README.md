# AI-Powered-Medical-Diagnosis-System-
AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System

🔍 Overview

This project is an AI-powered medical diagnosis system designed to predict multiple diseases, including Heart Disease, Lung Cancer, Parkinson’s Disease, Hypothyroidism, and Eye Diseases (Glaucoma, Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy, Normal Eye). It leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for medical diagnosis and is deployed as a Streamlit-based web application for accessibility.

🚀 Features

AI-based disease diagnosis using structured and image-based datasets.

Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Decision Trees, and SVMs for classification.

Web application for easy access using Streamlit.

Pretrained models for fast and accurate disease prediction.
